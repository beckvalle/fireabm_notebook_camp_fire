## Camp Fire Case Study
#### By Rebecca Vandewalle, Furqan Baig, Santiago Nunez-Corrales, Jeon Young Kang, and Shaowen Wang

### Start here
Run the Camp Fire Notebook for a demonstration of the simulation applied to Paradise, CA.

For more detail on how the wildfire evacuation simulation works, refer to the FireABM_Demo_Notebook.ipynb.

### How to run the Jupyter Notebook
The easiest way to run the code is to open the notebook directly with [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/) (requires registration) by clicking this link: [Launch with CyberGISX](https://cybergisx.cigi.illinois.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcybergis%2FFireABM_Modeling_Notebook&urlpath=tree%2FFireABM_Modeling_Notebook%2FFireABM_Demo_Notebook.ipynb&branch=master)
